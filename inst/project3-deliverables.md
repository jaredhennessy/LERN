# Project 3 Deliverables

- **Milestone 1 (7/28):** A detailed plan of action with the following:

  - An overview of the intended application and WHY you feel it's valuable.

  - A breakdown of roles by group member.

  - A schedule for completion of various tasks.

  - A screenshot of your Jira, Trello, or Project Management Board that shows breakdown of tasks assigned to group members with a schedule.

  - A set of DETAILED screen-by-screen design layouts with annotations describing all UI/UX components and all data relevant to the screen.

    - On this note, show Slides 26-27 as an example of a UI/UX and Data Flow layout. Tell the class that you'll expect something akin to these drafts.

- **Milestone 2 (8/4):** A functioning **minimal viable product** (i.e., a prototype version of your app that shows the intended function). This should be as close to a working app as possible and include:

  - A 5-7 minute presentation that discusses what your app is, what it does, and how it works. You will be presenting to instructors and TAs during class.

  - A screenshot of your Jira, Trello, or Project Management Board that shows breakdown of tasks assigned to group members with a schedule. This should be updated to reflect remaining priorities and completed tasks.

- **Milestone 3 (8/11):** A significantly more polished version of the app.

  - This should literally seem like an app that you would submit.

  - Include a summary of significant issues faced to date and their resolution.

  - Provide a detailed description of each person's contributions.

  - Submit a detailed plan that describes remaining efforts. This should describe remaining issues like:
    - Stretch Features
    - Bugs
    - Enhancements
    - UI Polishing

- **Milestone 4 (8/15):** The Presentation!
  - A 7-10 minute demonstration of your app.
  - More on this as we near closer to the end.
